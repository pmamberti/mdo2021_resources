# MacDevOps 2021

This is a repository to store anything related to my talk, "Kanban is your friend". 
You can find my slides and my notes in this repo too.

## Resources about Kanban
This is a non-complete set of links and materials that I think may be useful to learn more about Kanban, boards, and delivering value at a *sustainable* pace.

### Get started
- [Make Work Visible](https://itrevolution.com/book/making-work-visible/) by Dominica DeGrandis: probably the most practical, simple and straightforward introduction to making your work visible.
- [Making Work Visible: How to Unmask Capacity Killing WIP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KR7Y8IUgyyA): if you prefer videos, this is a talk that covers some of the topics in the 'Make Work Visible' Book.
- [Thinking in Systems - A primer](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3828902-thinking-in-systems) by Donella Meadows. An intro to systems thinking, that will help you understand how feedback loops influence systems. Simple and concise, full of good examples.

### On work limits
- [Why limiting work-in-progress works](https://lethain.com/limiting-wip/) by Will Larson ([@lethain](https://twitter.com/lethain))
- [Putting the 'flow' back in workflow with WIP limits](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/kanban/wip-limits) from Atlassian themselves


### More about Lean, Agile, DevOps

- [Allen Holub](https://twitter.com/allenholub)'s recommended [reading list](https://holub.com/reading): a treasure trove of information on Lean, Agile, along with other important things such as psychological safety. Pace yourself reading through these, as each of them is really full of information.
